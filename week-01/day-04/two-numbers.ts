// Create a program that prints a few operations on two numbers: 22 and 13
// Print the result of 13 added to 22
// Print the result of 13 substracted from 22
// Print the result of 22 multiplied by 13
// Print the result of 22 divided by 13 (as a decimal fraction)
// Print the reminder of 22 divided by 13
